# mimic3-mortality 

## Introduction
- Mortality in ICUs are still very significant. Heterogenous patients and conditions create room for error and inefficiencies
- General considerations for ICUs
    - Mortality is not straight forward. Many mortalities (>50%) is due to patients being taken off of a life sustaining
    therapy. Thus it's important to think about how they end up there in the first place.
    - Why some patients that are on these therapies survive and why some don't. 
    - Also some patients do not 
 
## Outcomes and Predictors 
1. Outcomes 
    1. In-Hospital Mortality 
    2. Out-of-Hospital Mortality (30-day, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year) 
    3. Patients that survive on life-sustaining therapies 
2. Predictors
    1. Risk Scores
